<h2>Did you know that the war in Eastern Congo is the deadliest war since World War 2,
    with an estimated 5.4M death toll? source:<a

        here </a>
</h2>

<p>

    We hope to provide you with resources gathered by grass roots
    movement such as the <a href="http://www.raisehopeforcongo.org/">Enough Project </a>
    to bring awareness to this conflict,
    and hopefully help end the conflict mineral war in Eastern Congo,
    often disguised as <em> a civil or an ethnic war.</em><br>

    Despite uncovered media attention on such a magnitude conflict, we at CMBuzz urge you to pose yourself some logical
    questions.

    What makes the Eastern Congo war, a civil war, if the conflict involves 9 different African nations, within the same
    region? Isn't that intriguing that the region that is the most terrorized by rapes and other violent abuses, is the same
    region that has all of the conflict Minerals (here after "Coltan").
